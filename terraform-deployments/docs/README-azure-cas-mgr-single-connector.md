### 1. CAS Manager Single-Connector Architecture

The Cloud Access Software (CAS) Manager Single-Connector deployment creates a Virtual Network with 3 subnets in the same region, provided that the workstations defined in terraform.tfvars do not have distinct locations. The subnets created are:
- ```subnet-dc```: for the Domain Controller
- ```subnet-cac```: for the Connector
- ```subnet-ws```: for the workstations
- ```subnet-cas-mgr```: for the CAS Manager

Network Security Rules are created to allow wide-open access within the Virtual Network, and selected ports are open to the public for operation and for debug purposes.

A Domain Controller is created with Active Directory, DNS and LDAP-S configured. Domain Users are also created if a ```domain_users_list``` CSV file is specified. The Domain Controller is given a static IP (configurable).

A Cloud Access Connector is created and registers itself with the CAS Manager service with the given token and PCoIP registration code.

Multiple domain-joined workstations and Cloud Access Connectors can be optionally created, specified by the the ```workstations``` variable. This is a list of objects where each object defines a workstation.

Note: Since this is a single region deployment, please make sure that all ```location``` values in the ```workstations``` parameter are all identical.

These workstations are automatically domain-joined and have the PCoIP Agent installed.

The following diagram shows a CAS Manager single-connector deployment instance with multiple workstations and a single Cloud Access Connector deployed in the same region specified by the user. This deployments runs the CAS Manager in a virtual machine which gives users full control of the CAS deployment. The CAS deployment will not have to reach out to the internet for CAS management features, but the user is resonsible for costs, security, updates, high availability and maintenance of the virtual machine running CAS Manager.


### 2. Requirements
- Access to a subscription on Azure. 
- a PCoIP Registration Code. Contact sales [here](https://www.teradici.com/compare-plans) to purchase a subscription.
- A basic understanding of Azure, Terraform and using a command-line interpreter (Bash or PowerShell)
- [Terraform v0.13.5](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com) access.
- [PCoIP Client](https://docs.teradici.com/find/product/software-and-mobile-clients)

### 3. Service Principal Authentication
In order for Terraform to deploy & manage resources on a user's behalf, they must authenticate through a service principal. 
1. Login to the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com/)
2. Click **Azure Active Directory** in the left sidebar and click **App registrations** inside the opened blade.
3. Create a new application for the deployment by clicking **New registration**. If an application exists under **Owned applications**, this information can be reused. 
    - More detailed information on how to create a Service Principal can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#create-a-new-application-secret).
4. Copy the following information from the application overview: 
    - Client ID
    - Tenant ID
5. Under the same app, click **Certificates & secrets**.
6. Create a new Client Secret or use an existing secret. This value will only be shown once, make sure to save it.
7. Go to Subscriptions by searching **subscription** into the search bar and click on the subscription of choice.
8. Copy the **Subscription ID** and click on **Access control (IAM)** on the blade. 
9. Click **+ Add**, click **Add role assignments** and follow these steps to add roles:
    1. Under **Role**, click the dropdown and select the role **Reader**.
    2. Leave **Assign access to** as **User, group, or service principal**
    3. Under **Select** search for the application name from step 4 and click **Save**.
    4. Repeat steps i - iii for the role **Virtual Machine Contributor** and **Contributor**.

### 4. (Optional) Storing Secrets on Azure Key Vault

**Note**: This is optional. Users may skip this section and enter plaintext for the AD admin password, safe mode admin password, CAS Manager admin password, and PCoIP registration key in terraform.tfvars.

As a security method to help protect the values listed above, users can store them as secrets in an Azure Key Vault. Secrets will be decrypted in the configuration scripts.

1. In the Azure portal, search for **Key Vault** and click **+ Add** to create a new key vault. 
    1. Select the same region as the deployment.
    2. Click next to go to the Access policy page.
    3. Click **+ Add Access Policy**.
        1. Under **Configure from template** select **Secret Management**.
        2. Under **Select principal** click on **None selected**.
        3. Find the application from [section 3](#3-service-principal-authentication) and click **Select**. The ID underneath should match the Client ID/Application ID saved from earlier.
        4. Click **Review + create** and then **Create**.
2. Click on the key vault that was created and click on **Secrets** inside the rightmost blade.
3. To create **AD safe mode admin password**, **AD admin password**, **CAS Manager admin password**, and **PCoIP registration key** as secrets follow these steps for each value:
    1. Click **+ Generate/Import**.
    2. Enter the name of the secret.
    3. Input the secret value.
    4. Click **Create**.
    5. Click on the secret that was created, click on the version and copy the **Secret Identifier**. 
      - **Tip**: To reduce the chance of errors, verify the secret is correct by clicking on **Show Secret Value**.
5. Fill in the following variables. Below is a completed example with tips underneath that can aid in finding the values.
```
# (Encryption is optional) Following 3 values and cac_token from cac_configuration can be encrypted. 
# To encrypt follow section 4 of the documentation.
ad_admin_password             = "https://mykeyvault.vault.azure.net/secrets/adPasswordID/123abcexample"
safe_mode_admin_password      = "https://mykeyvault.vault.azure.net/secrets/safeAdminPasswordID/123abcexample"
cas_mgr_admin_password        = "https://mykeyvault.vault.azure.net/secrets/casManagerPasswordID/123abcexample"
pcoip_registration_code       = "https://mykeyvault.vault.azure.net/secrets/pcoipSecretID/123abcexample"

# Used for authentication and allows Terraform to manage resources.
application_id                = "4928a0xd-e1re-592l-9321-5f114953d88c"
aad_client_secret             = "J492L_1KR2plr1SQdgndGc~gE~pQ.eR3F."

# Only fill these when using Azure Key Vault secrets.
# Examples and tips can be found in section 4 of the documentation.
# tenant_id                     = "31f56g8-1k3a-q43e-1r3x-dc340b62cf18"
# key_vault_id                  = "/subscriptions/12e06/resourceGroups/keyvault/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/mykeyvault"
# ad_pass_secret_name           = "adPasswordID"
```
- Tips for finding these variables:
    1. ```application_id``` and ```tenant_id``` are from [section 3](#3-service-principal-authentication) step 4.
    2. ```aad_client_secret```: This is the same secret from [section 3](#3-service-principal-authentication). If this secret is no longer saved, follow section 3 from steps 1-3 & 5-6 to obtain a new client secret.
    3. ```key_vault_id```: Go to the key vault containing the secrets on the Portal and click on **Properties** inside the opened blade. Copy the **Resource ID**.
    4. ```ad_pass_secret_name```: This is the name used for the ad pass secret. The name can be seen after```/secrets/``` from the variable ```ad_admin_password```. From the example above, this would be ```adPasswordID```.
    
### 5. (Optional) Assigning a SSL Certificate

**Note**: This is optional. Assigning a SSL certificate will prevent the PCoIP client from reporting an insecure connection when establishing a PCoIP session though users may still connect. Read more [here](https://www.teradici.com/web-help/pcoip_cloud_access_manager/CACv2/prerequisites/cac_certificate/). It is also an option to assign an SSL certificate **after** the completion of the script. More information can be found [here](https://www.teradici.com/web-help/review/cam_cac_v2/installation/updating_cac/#updating-ssl-certificates).

To upload a SSL certificate and SSL key onto ACS:
  1. Go into the **Resource group** that contains ACS storage. By default, the name should look like: **cloud-shell-storage-[region]**
  2. Click on the storage account being used for deployment.
  3. Next, click **File shares** and then click the file share that is mounted onto ACS.
  4. Upload the SSL certificate and SSL key. Must be in .pem format.
  5. The location of these files will be found in ```~/clouddrive/```
  6. Enter the paths to the SSL certificate and SSL key inside ```terraform.tfvars```.

### 6. Deploying via Terraform
terraform.tfvars is the file in which a user specifies variables for a deployment. The ```terraform.tfvars.sample``` sample file shows the required variables that a user must provide, along with other commonly used but optional variables. 

**Note**: Uncommented lines show required variables, while commented lines show optional variables with their default or sample values.

Before deploying, ```terraform.tfvars``` must be complete. 
1. Clone the repository into your Azure Cloud Shell (ACS) environment.
  - ```git clone https://github.com/teradici/Azure_Deployments```
2. Change directory into: ```/terraform-deployments/deployments/single-connector```.
  - ```cd Azure_Deployments/terraform-deployments/deployments/load-balancer```.
2. Save ```terraform.tfvars.sample``` as ```terraform.tfvars```, and fill out the required variables.
    - To copy: ```cp terraform.tfvars.sample terraform.tfvars```
    - To configure: ```code terraform.tfvars```
    - To include optional variables, uncomment the line by removing preceding ```#```.
    - Make sure the locations of the connectors and work stations are identical.
    
    ```terraform.tfvars``` variables:

    1. workstation configuration:
        - ```prefix```: prefix added to workstation machines. e.g.: 'tera0' will name a standard Linux VM **tera0**-scent-0
            -   Must be a max of 5 characters to avoid name cropping. Can be left blank.
        - ```location```: location of the workstation. **westus** machines will be placed in the West US region. 
            -   Possible values: [Regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/geographies/). 
            -   e.g. West US 2 will be inputted as **westus2**. Central US as **centralus**.
        - ```workstation_os```: Operating system of the workstation.
            -   Possible values: **windows** or **linux**
        - ```vm_size```: Size of the virtual machine. 
            -   Possible values: [VM Sizes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes). 
        - ```disk_type```: Type of storage for the workstation. 
            -   Possible values: **Standard_LRS**, **StandardSSD_LRS** or **Premium_LRS**
        - ```count```: Number of workstations to deploy under the specific settings.
        - ```isGFXHost```: Determines if a Grahpics Agent will be installed. Graphics agents require [**NV-series VMs**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/nv-series) or [**NCasT4_v3-series VMs**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/nct4-v3-series). The default size in .tfvars is **Standard_NV6**. Additional VM sizes can be seen in the [**Appendix**](#appendix)
            -   Possible values: **true** or **false**
3. **(Optional)** To add domain users save ```domain_users_list.csv.sample``` as ```domain_users_list.csv``` and edit this file accordingly.
    - **Note:** To add users successfully, passwords must have atleast **3** of the following requirements:
      - 1 UPPERCASE letter
      - 1 lowercase letter
      - 1 number
      - 1 special character. e.g.: ```!@#$%^&*(*))_+```
4. Run ```terraform init``` to initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files.
5. Run ```terraform apply | tee -a installer.log``` to display resources that will be created by Terraform. 
    - **Note:** Users can also do ```terraform apply``` but often ACS will time out or there are scrolling limitations which prevents users from viewing all of the script output. ```| tee -a installer.log``` stores a local log of the script output which can be referred to later to help diagnose problems.
6. Answer ```yes``` to start provisioning the single-connector infrastructure. 

A typical deployment should take around 35-40 minutes. When finished, the scripts will display VM information such as IP addresses. At the end of the deployment, the resources may still take a few minutes to start up completely. It takes a few minutes for a connector to sync with the CAS Manager so **Health** statuses may show as **Unhealthy** temporarily. 

Example output:
```
Apply complete! Resources: 67 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

cac-public-ip = [
  [
    "public_ip" = "52.109.24.176"
  ],
]
cas-mgr-public-ip = "52.109.24.178"
centos-graphics-workstations = [
  {
    "name" = "gcent-0"
    "private_ip" = "10.0.4.5"
  },
]
centos-standard-workstations = [
  {
    "name" = "scent-0"
    "private_ip" = "10.0.4.6"
  },
]
domain-controller-private-ip = "10.0.1.4"
domain-controller-public-ip = "52.109.24.161"
resource_group = "single_connector_deployment_c4fe3"
windows-standard-workstations = [
  {
    "name" = "swin-0"
    "private_ip" = "10.0.4.4"
  },
]
windows-graphics-workstations = [
  {
    "name" = "gwin-0"
    "private_ip" = "10.0.4.7"
  },
]
```
    
### 7. Adding Workstations in CAS Manager
To connect to workstations, they have to be added through CAS Manager. 
1. In a browser, enter ```https://<cas-mgr-public-ip>```.
    - The default username for CAS Manager is ```adminUser```.
2. Click Workstations on the right sidebar, click the blue **+** and select **Add existing remote workstation**. 
3. From the **Provider** dropdown, select **Private Cloud**.
6. In the search box below, select Windows and CentOS workstations.
7. At the bottom click the option **Individually select users** and select the users to assign to the workstations. 
    - **Note:** If assigning certain users to certain workstations, remove workstations under **Remote workstations to be added (x)**.
8. Click **Save**.

Note that it may take a 5-10 minutes for the workstation to show up in the **Select Remote Workstations** drop-down box.

### 8. Starting a PCoIP Session
Once the workstations have been added by CAS Manager and assigned to Active Directory users, a user can connect through the PCoIP client using the public IP of the Cloud Access Connector. 

1. Open the Teradici PCoIP Client and click on **NEW CONNECTION**.
2. Enter the public IP address of the Cloud Access Connector (CAC) virtual machine and enter a name for this connection. 
    - **Note**: If the ```public_ip``` of the ```cac-public-ip``` output does not show at the end of completion due to error it can be found on the Azure Portal. Select the machine ```[prefix]-cac-vm-0``` and the **Public IP address** will be shown.
3. Input the credentials from the account that was assigned under **User Entitlements for Workstations** from section 7 step 5. 
4. Click on a machine to start a PCoIP session.
5. To connect to different workstations, close the PCoIP client and repeat steps 1-4.

### 9. Changing the deployment
Terraform is a declarative language to describe the desired state of resources. A user can modify terraform.tfvars and run ```terraform apply``` again. Terraform will try to only apply the changes needed to acheive the new state.

### 10. Deleting the deployment
Run ```terraform destroy -force``` to remove all resources created by Terraform. If this command doesn't delete everything entirely due to error, another alternative is to delete the resource group itself from the **Resource groups** page in Azure. 

### 11. Troubleshooting
- If the console looks frozen, try pressing Enter to unfreeze it.
- If no machines are showing up on CAS Managepr or get errors when connecting via PCoIP client, wait 2 minutes and retry. 
- If trying to run a fresh deployment and have been running into errors, delete all files containing  ```.tfstate```. These files store the state of the current infrastructure and configuration. 
- If there is a timeout error regarding **centos-gfx** machine(s) at the end of the deployment, this is because script extensions time out after 30 minutes. This happens sometimes but users can still add VMs to CAS Manager.
    - As a result of this, there will be no outputs displaying on ACS. The IP address of the cac machine can be found by going into the deployment's resource group, selecting the machine ```[prefix]-cac-vm-0```, and the **Public IP address** will be shown on the top right.

Information about connecting to virtual machines for investigative purposes:
- CentOS and Windows VMs do not have public IPs. To connect to a **CentOS** workstations use the Connector (cac-vm) as a bastion host.
    1. SSH into the Connector. ```ssh <ad_admin_username>@<cac-public-ip>``` e.g.: ```cas_admin@52.128.90.145```
    2. From inside the Connector, SSH into the CentOS workstation. ```ssh centos_admin@<centos-internal-ip>``` e.g.: ```ssh centos_admin@10.0.4.5```
    3. The installation log path for CentOS workstations are located in ```/var/log/teradici/agent/install.log```. CAC logs are located in ```/var/log/teradici/cac-install.log```.
- If ACS times out and takes all the terrafrom logs with it, you can set it up before you deplay ```terraform apply``` Terraform depends on two environment variables being configured. TF_LOG which could be set to DEBUG, INFO, WARN, or ERROR. The second one TF_LOG_PATH sets the path and file that logs will be logged into: terraformLogs.txt, however, it can be named whatever you like


  - PowerShell:
```$env:TF_LOG="TRACE"```
```$env:TF_LOG_PATH="terraform.txt"```

  - Bash:
```export TF_LOG="TRACE"```
```export TF_LOG_PATH="terraform.txt"```


- To connect to a **Windows** workstations use the Domain Controller (dc-vm) as a bastion host. 
- **Note**: By default RDP is disabled for security purposes. Before running a deployment switch the **false** flag to **true** for the **create_debug_rdp_access** variable in **terraform.tfvars**. If there is already a deployment present go into the **Networking** settings for the dc-vm and click **Add inbound port rule**. Input **3389** in the **Destination port ranges** and click **Add**. Users should now be able to connect via RDP.
    1. RDP into the Domain Controller virtual machine. 
    
    ```
    Computer: <domain-controller-public-ip>
    User: cas_admin
    Password: <ad_admin_password from terraform.tfvars>
    ```
   2. From inside the Domain Controller, RDP into the Windows workstation. 
    
    ```
    Computer: <win-internal-ip>
    User: windows_admin
    Password: <ad_admin_password from terraform.tfvars>
    ```
   3. The installation log path for Windows workstations and DC machines are located in ```C:/Teradici/provisioning.log```.
